                  <p class="small">
                    Planks, are one of the most effective exercises, that you can do, anywhere, without any equipment
                    needed and if you do it regularly, you can see results in a short period of time! They don’t 
                    require much time or effort to do and <strong>anyone, at any fitness level can do it.</strong> Here are some 
                    benefits of doing plank daily:
                  </p>
                  <br><br>
                  <p class="big">1. Your core strength will improve</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    One of the top benefits of doing planks regularly, is that they <strong>strengthen the core-muscles</strong>, 
                    bones and joints that link the upper and lower body. Their strengthening will give you an 
                    increased ability to lift heavy things, form a waistline and provide support for you back.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="big">2. You will strengthen your back</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    While some exercises to work the core can actually weaken and potentially injure the back 
                    (such as sit-ups or crunches),  the plank will actually help to strengthen it! It also, 
                    doesn’t add any unnecessary strain on the spine and can also <strong>reduce back pain</strong>, if they 
                    are done regularly , as well as <strong>providing strong support to your spine</strong>, especially its 
                    upper part. It can also <strong>improve your posture</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="big">3. Your metabolism accelerates</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    Because you are engaging four major muscle groups (traverse abdominis, rectus abdominis, 
                    obliques and glutes), while trying to maintain and hold up your body, you challenge your 
                    body like this in short bursts. As a result, it <strong>increases your metabolism</strong> which helps you 
                    <strong>burn more energy when sedentary</strong>. A daily ten-minute workout, provides a higher level of 
                    metabolism throughout the day, even during sleep!
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="big">4. It improves your coordination and makes you more flexible</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    Doing plank exercises like the side plank, it will help you learn to <strong>keep your balance</strong> 
                    if performed regularly. Working out in this way, you stretch the muscles around shoulders, 
                    scapula and collarbones. Biceps and hip muscles also develop and your feet and toes become 
                    <strong>more flexible</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="big">5. Your mood lifts up</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    The planking exercise <strong>affects your nervous system</strong>. It stretches and relaxes muscles which 
                    are usually stiffened due to stress, creating tension throughout the body. Plank also help 
                    to <strong>get rid of anxiety and symptoms of depression</strong>, if they are done in daily basis.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p class="small">
                    All in all, plank is an easy exercise that everyone can put on their daily workout routine 
                    and can be performed easily everywhere. It can <strong>boost your fitness level</strong> and benefit you 
                    in multiple ways. There is no reason for you to not get into doing planks regularly, so <strong>start now!</strong>
