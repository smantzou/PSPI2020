                        achiece the "calories burnt > calories eaten" equation, but there is more to that. Even if you know what you 
                        have to do, it is not always easy to start doing it, in an efficient<strong>, for you, way.</strong> Here

                    <p class="big">Start strength training</p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Strength training is doing body-weight exercises, lifting weights or using gym equipment. It is a type of 
                        exercise that builds muscle mass and increases strength and it has multiple health benefits, especially 
                        when it comes to burning fat. Strength training reduces visceral fat (a type of dangerous fat, that surrounds
                        the organs in the belly) and if combined with aerobic exercises, it is more effective at reducing body and 
                        belly fat, than aerobic alone. Resistance training may also help preserve fat-free mass, which can increase
                        the number of calories your body burns at rest. <strong>In conclusion, strength training has been shown 
                        to increase resisting energy expenditure and reduce belly fat, especially when combined with aerobic exercise.</strong>

                    <p class="big">Increase Cardio</p>
                    <p class="small">
                        As we said above, resistance training alone is not doing much in terms of losing excess body weight, but 
                        combined with cardio exercise (also known as aerobic exercise) it may lead to the best possible results.
                        Cardio is one the most common form of exercises and is defined as any type of excercise that specifically trains 
                        the heart and lungs. The more aerobic exercise people are getting, <strong>the more belly fat they lose</strong>, 
                        according to 16 studies, and other studies have found that it can <strong>increase muscle mass and decrease
                        belly fat, waist circumference and body fat.</strong> Most research recommends between <strong>20-40 of cardio 
                        each day.</strong> Do a cardio exercise that fits you the most so you can keep doing it for as long as you can!
                    </p>

                    <p class="big">Try High-Intensity Interval Training</p>
                    <p class="small">
                        High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), is a form of exercise that pairs quick burst of activity with short 
                        recovery periods to keep your heart rate elevated. HITT can be very effective on burning fat and promoting 
                        weight loss. One study found that people <strong>performing HITT for 20 minutes, three times weekly,</strong> lost 
                        2Kg over a 12 week period, even with no other changes to their diet or lifestyle and they also experienced a 
                        <strong>17% reduction in belly fat and decrease in waist circumference.</strong> HITT may also help you burn more 
                        calories in a shorter amount of time, than other forms of cardio (<strong>30% more calories burnt</strong> than other 
                        types such as cycling or jogging according to a study).
                    </p>
