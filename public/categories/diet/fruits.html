                        Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber. Fruits also provide a wide range of health-boosting antioxidants, including flavonoids.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce a person’s risk of developing heart disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes. Citrus fruits and berries may be especially powerful for preventing disease.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        A 2014 study ranked “powerhouse” fruit and vegetables by high nutrient density and low calories. Lemons came out top of the list, followed by strawberry, orange, lime, and pink and red grapefruit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        In this article, we look at the nutrition and the many and varied health benefits of these and other fruits you can find in the supermarket.
                    </p>
                    <p class="big">1. Lemons</p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Lemons are a citrus fruit that people often use in traditional remedies because of their health benefits. Like other citrus fruits, they contain vitamin C and other antioxidants. <br><br>
                        Antioxidants are essential for human health. These compounds mop up free radicals in the body that can damage the body’s cells and lead to diseases, such as cancers. <br> <br>
                        Researchers believe that the flavonoids in lemon and other citrus fruits have antibacterial, anticancer, and antidiabetic properties.<br> <br>
                        Citrus fruits, including lemons, contain active components called phytochemicals that benefit health. These include:<br>
                         <ul>
                            <li>vitamin C</li>
                            <li>folic acid</li>
                            <li>potassium</li>
                            <li>pectin</li>
                        </ul>
                        Lemons also contain thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-6, folate, and vitamin A.
                        <br><br><strong>How to eat lemons</strong>How to eat lemons <br>
                        Use the juice of a lemon to flavor drinking water or squeeze over a salad or fish. Try adding lemon juice to boiling water with a teaspoon of honey to help soothe a sore throat. It is also possible to eat the rind of organic lemons. Some people use the rind in recipes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="big">2. Strawberries</p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Strawberries are a juicy, red fruit with a high water content. The seeds provide plenty of dietary fiber per serving. Strawberries contain many healthful vitamins and minerals.<br> <br>Of particular note, they contain anthocyanins, which are flavonoids that can help boost heart health. The fiber and potassium in strawberries can also support a healthy heart.
                        <br><br>In one study, women who ate 3 or more servings per week of strawberries and blueberries — which are both known for their high anthocyanin content — had a lower risk of having a heart attack than those with lower intake.<br><br>
                        Strawberries and other colorful berries also contain a flavonoid called quercetin. This is a natural anti-inflammatory compound.

                        Strawberries also contain thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and vitamins B-6, A and K.
                        <br><br><strong>How to eat strawberries</strong><br>
                        Strawberries are a versatile fruit. People can eat them raw or add them to breakfast cereals or yogurt, blend them into a smoothie, or make them into jam.

                    <p class="big">3. Bananas</p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Bananas are well known for their high potassium content. A medium banana contains 422 mg of the adequate adult intake of 4,500 mg of potassium. Potassium helps the body control heart rate and blood pressure.
                        <br><br>
                        Bananas are also a good source of energy, with one banana containing 105 calories and 26.95 g of carbohydrate.
                        <br><br>
                        The 3.1 g of fiber in a regular banana can also help with regular bowel movements and stomach issues, such as ulcers and colitis.
                        <br><br>A medium banana also contains the following nutrients:
                        <ul>
                            <li>1.29 g protein</li>

                        </ul>
                        <strong>How to eat bananas</strong><br>
                        A banana is an excellent fruit to use to thicken a smoothie. People can also use them in baking as a natural sweetener or to make banana bread or pancakes.

                        <strong>How to eat limes</strong><br>
                        Limes work well in savory foods. Try adding the juice or grated peel of a lime to flavor salad dressings or rice dishes. Otherwise, juice a lime and add to hot or cold water for a refreshing drink.

                    <p class="big">5.Grapefruit</p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Grapefruits are sour fruits full of health-inducing vitamins and minerals. Grapefruits can be pink, red, or white.
                        <br><br>Half a grapefruit contains the following nutrients:
                        <ul>
                            <li>52 calories</li>

                        </ul>
                        The flavonoids in grapefruits can help protect against some cancers, inflammation, and obesity.
                        <br>
                        A review study suggests the compounds called furanocoumarins found in grapefruits can help protect against oxidative stress and tumors and may support healthy bones.
                        <br><br>Some research from this review suggests that grapefruit furanocoumarins may have anticancer properties, which may be especially effective against breast cancer, skin cancer, and leukemia. Researchers still need to carry out more studies on animals and humans to confirm these properties. <br><br>People may wish to see a doctor before adding grapefruit to their diet, as it can interact with certain medications.
                        <strong>How to eat grapefruit</strong><br>
                        Try adding grapefruit slices to a fruit salad, or squeeze the juice into water to make a drink. Otherwise, people can buy pure grapefruit juice from the supermarket.

                        Blackberries contain many seeds, so they have a high fiber content. This means they can help improve gut health and heart health.
                        <br><br>
                        Half a cup of blackberries contains the following nutrients:

                    <p class="big">7. Apples</p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Apples make a quick and easy addition to the diet. Eat them with the skin on for the greatest health benefits.
                        <br><br>
                        Apples are high-fiber fruits, meaning that eating them could boost heart health and promote weight loss. The pectin in apples helps to maintain good gut health.
                        <br><br>One medium apple contains the following nutrients:
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        Research has shown that there is a link between eating apples regularly and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and diabetes.
                        <br><br>
                        Apples also have high levels of quercetin, a flavonoid which may have anti-cancer properties.
                        <br><br>
                        One study found that people who ate whole apples were 30 percent less likely to be obese than those who did not. This can lower the risk for diabetes and heart disease.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>How to eat apples</strong><br>
                        Raw apples make a great snack and combining them with almond butter helps balance protein and fat intake. People can also add raw or stewed apples to yogurt, or use applesauce in cooking.
