                  <p class="small">
                    Jumping rope is like getting an all-in-one <strong>stress-busting, strength-building, 
                    endurance-boosting, HIIT cardio machine that also fights against sports injuries, 
                    and it costs basically nothing.</strong> Jumping rope will do wonders for any workout, 
                    and there are tons of reasons why you need to incorporate it into your fitness plan!
                  </p>
                  <br><br>
                  <p class="big">1. Improves Coordination</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    Jumping rope actually improves your coordination by making you focus on your feet. 
                    Whether or not you’re paying attention to them, <strong>your brain is aware of what your 
                    feet are doing.</strong> This practice, over and over again, makes you “lighter” on your feet.
                    The more tricks you can do with the jump rope, the more conscious and coordinated you 
                    have to be.

                  <br>
                  <p class="big">2. Decreases Foot and Ankle Injuries and Improves Bone Density</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    Jumping rope not only improves your foot coordination but also increases your strength 
                    in the muscles surrounding your ankle joint and in your foot, decrease the chance of 
                    injury to those areas. It is said, that <strong>the best way to improve bone density, is simply
                      jumping up and down.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p class="big">3. Burns Major Calories</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    Compared to jogging for 30 minutes, jumping rope actually <strong>burns more calories.</strong> According to 
                    Science Daily, “This aerobic exercise can achieve a “burn rate” of <strong>up to 1300 calories per 
                    hour</strong> of vigorous activity, with about 0.1 calories consumed per jump, while jogging, burns 
                    about 600-700.

                  <br>
                  <p class="big">4. Improves Cardiovascular Health and Breathing Efficiency</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    According to the American College of Sports Medicine, skipping rope is highly recommended for 
                    aerobic conditioning. In order to increase your heart and lung health you must do it three to 
                    five times per week for 12 to 20 minutes at a time. In addition to <strong>improved heart health and 
                    stamina, jumping rope also improves how efficiently you breathe.</strong>

                  <p class="big">5. Makes You Smarter</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    Believe it or not, jumping rope can make you smarter. According the Jump Rope Institute, <strong>jumping 
                    aids in the development of the left and right hemispheres of your brain, which further enhances 
                    spacial awareness, improves reading skills, increases memory and makes you more mentally alert.</strong> 
                    Jumping on the balls of your feet requires your body and mind to make neural muscular adjustments 
                    to imbalances created from continuous jumping. As a result jumping improves dynamic balance and 
                    coordination, reflexes, bone density and muscular endurance.

                  <p class="big">6. Full-Body Training</p>
                  <p class="small">
                    When initiating the beginning phase of a jump rope exercise, you rely on the lower body to generate 
                    power and lift you off the ground. To perform this move, you need to recruit the powerful muscles 
                    in your <strong>quadriceps, hamstrings and glutes.</strong> You also need to rely on your <strong>calves</strong> to help you hop when 
                    the rope goes under your feet, which the American Council on Exercise says helps strengthen the calf 
                    muscles and improves the elasticity of the surrounding tendons and fascia. It's obvious that jump 
                    rope benefits your lower body, but it's not just these muscles that do all the work. The muscles in 
                    your upper body, and more specifically, the <strong>shoulders, biceps, triceps and forearms</strong> all work together 
                    to rotate the rope around your body. And last, but certainly not least, <strong>your abdominal muscles</strong> will 
                    feel the burn when skipping rope. Since balance, athleticism and coordination are required to perform 
                    this move successfully, you will need to rely on your core muscles to generate power, support your 
                    lower back and keep your posture upright. All these benefits are greatly echanced if you do different
                    and certain variation of the exercise , or if you do it with different type of ropes(weighted or 
                    speed ropes i.e.).
                  </p>
                  <br><br>
                  <p class="small">
                    Jumping rope is an easy exercise , that can be done <strong>by anyone and at any fitness level.</strong> It is a fan 
                    way of working out and there are plenty of skills that you can develop throughout your training. 
                    <strong>Start skipping today, and the immidiate results won't disappoint you!</strong>
