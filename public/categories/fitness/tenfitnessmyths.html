                    <h1>Top 10 Fitness Myths</h1>
                    <p class="small">When it comes to working out, we hear a lot of stuff about what to do and don't to stay in shape.
                    But what is actually true afterall?
                    </p>
                    <p class="writer">By active.com</p>

                    <p class="big">1.Myth:You can target your fat burn.</p>
                   
                    <p class="small">Working out can reduce your overall body fat, 
                        but you can't control where that fat comes from. In a new study published in 
                        Journal of Strength & Conditioning, 11 people completed a 12-week exercise program 
                        to train a single leg. Even though they only trained on one side, they lost about 
                        the same amount of body fat in each leg—and burned even more body fat above the waist.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="big">2.Myth:You shouldn't work out on an empty stomach.</p>
                    
                    <p class="small">Your body burns more fat when you hit the gym before you eat breakfast,
                         according to a new study published online in the British Journal of Nutrition. 
                         Just don't skimp on water.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="big">3.Myth:No pain,no gain.</p>
                    <p class="small">
                        A little discomfort is okay, but if you feel a sharp pain anywhere,
                         stop what you're doing and consult a doc, says exercise physiologist
                          Dayna Davidson.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="big">4.Myth:You should strech before you work out.</p>
                    
                    <p class="small">Stretching loosens your tendons, and makes muscles feel weaker and 
                        less steady, according to a new study. So a pre-workout stretch can actually mess 
                        with your workout.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="big">5.Myth:Lifting heavy weight bulks you up.</p>
                    
                    <p class="small">Actually, it can slim you down. Women who lift a challenging 
                        weight for eight reps burn nearly twice as many calories as women who do 15 
                        reps with lighter dumbbells, according to a study published in Medicine & Science 
                        in Sports & Exercise.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="big">6.Myth:Exercise machines beat free wieghts.</p>
                   
                    <p class="small">Many exercise machines are actually designed for men, which can make it 
                        tough for women to nail proper form when you use them. And because machines isolate 
                        specific muscles, you actually burn fewer calories on a machine than you do when you 
                        exercise freestyle.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="big">7.Myth:Running on a treadmill is as effective as running outside.</p>
                    
                    <p class="small">Because running against wind or on uneven terrain engages more of your muscles, 
                        it requires more energy and ends up burning about 10 percent more calories than running the 
                        same distance on a treadmill.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="big">8.Myth:You shouldn't work out every day.</p>
                    
                    <p class="small">Rest should be part of your workout, not an alternative to your workout, 
                        says Barbara Bushman, Ph.D., a professor of kinesiology at Missouri State University.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="big">9.Myth:You can't work out when you're sick. </p>
                   
                    <p class="small">As long as you don't have a fever and your symptoms are above the neck
                         (think: stuffy nose or sore throat, not chest congestion or indigestion), you can 
                         totally hit the gym. Just listen to your body—or ask your doc if you're unsure.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="big">10.Myth:Sweating means you're out of shape.</p>
                    <img src="../images/stretching.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="woman-stretching">
                    <p class="small"> "It sounds counterintuitive, but the fitter you are, the sooner your body begins to sweat,
                         so a person who's in extremely good shape will produce more sweat than somebody who isn't," says Beth Stover,
                          M.S., C.S.C.S., a senior scientist at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute in Barrington, Illinois. 
                          "With each workout, you become a more and more efficient sweating machine."
