                    <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
                    <p class="small">
                        By now, you’ve probably heard someone mention CBD, especially if you live with a chronic condition like pain or anxiety.

                        As U.S. states begin to legalize both medical and recreational cannabis, the market has enjoyed an influx of readily available CBD. Despite all the publicity, though, many people are unsure of what CBD is, how it can help them, and if it’s even legal.

                        If you’re looking to try CBD but aren’t sure where to start, we put together this quick, handy guide to answer your questions and help clear up some of the common misconceptions surrounding CBD and its uses.
                    </p>

                    <h3><b>What is CBD?</b></h3>
                    <p class="small">
                        Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of many active compounds found in the Cannabis plant. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is another active compound and the most well-known, thanks to its psychoactive properties — it’s the one that gets you “high.”

                        CBD is nonpsychoactive but has a number of the same medical benefits as THC. This allows you to take advantage of the therapeutic benefits without leaving you with the “stoned” feeling that often goes hand in hand with THC.

                        That said, marijuana-derived CBD products, or CBD products that contain THC, may be more effective than fiber hemp. But if you live in a state that hasn’t yet legalized medical marijuana or these strains are unavailable, you can still benefit from products containing industrial hemp-derived CBD.

                        We suggest checking your state’s laws regarding CBD oil.
                    </p>

                    <h3><b>What does CBD treat?</b></h3>
                    <p class="small">
                        There’s not a lot of research on CBD, but the results of what has been studied are promising. Some studies have found CBD may be effective in providing relief from various mental health conditions, including:
                        
                        <ul class="small">
                            <li>anxiety disorders</li>
                            <li>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
                            <li>addiction</li>
                            <li>schizophrenia</li>
                        </ul>

                        It may be effective for physical conditions as well. One study on rats found that CBD oil may treat pain associated with arthritis, while another study on human cells found that CBD cream was an effective anti-inflammatory.

                        Likewise, CBD has also been proven to help treat childhood epilepsy and other seizure disorders. Some evidence points to CBD’s anticancer properties and benefits in managing the side effects of cancer treatment.

                        More research is needed to determine the benefits of using CBD as a treatment for mental and physical health conditions.
                    </p>

                    <h3><b>How do I take CBD?</b></h3>
                    <p class="small">
                        CBD is available in several different forms. This allows people to tailor their method of use to their specific need. Here are the most common forms of CBD:
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Oils and tinctures</b></h4>
                    <p class="small">
                        These liquids, usually oils, are infused with CBD and placed under the tongue with a dropper. The oral mucosa is full of tiny capillaries that absorb the compounds quickly.

                        Oils and tinctures are a good choice for anyone who can’t take pills or capsules.
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Creams and lotions</b></h4>
                    <p class="small">
                        CBD-infused topicals are used to treat muscle and joint pain. They can also treat some skin conditions, like eczema and psoriasis.
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Capsules and pills</b></h4>
                    <p class="small">
                        CBD capsules and pills are used for systemic treatment of seizure disorders and digestive issues. The Food and Drug Administration recently approved Epidiolex, the first high-potency CBD drug to treat seizure disorders.

                        There’s one drawback with capsule forms, though. The time from ingestion to onset of effect can take a while.
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Edibles</b></h4>
                    <p class="small">
                        Gummies are one of the most popular ways to take CBD. They’re affordable, portable, discrete, and tasty. There’s also no guesswork involved: You know exactly what dose you’re taking.
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Vaping</b></h4>
                    <p class="small">
                        Inhaling vaporized CBD oil, like e-cigs for CBD, is the fastest way to experience effects. Compounds are inhaled and absorbed directly from the lungs into the bloodstream.

                        The jury is still out, though, on whether vaping does damage to delicate lung tissue. Proceed with caution if you choose to vape CBD.
                    </p>

                    <h3><b>How much should I take?</b></h3>
                    <p class="small">
                        You should generally start with a low dosage and go slow with increasing your dose. There may also be variations in actual CBD content between products. Use caution when starting a new package or switching dose forms.

                        According to Lindsay Slowiczek, PharmD, “It's important to start with a low dose until you know how your body will react to CBD. A wide range of CBD dosages has been tested in clinical studies, but more evidence is needed before safe and effective dose recommendations can be made for specific uses."

                        "For now, use the product's recommended dose unless your doctor gives you the go-ahead to take larger doses," she continued. "People with certain health conditions, such as liver disease, may need lower doses to avoid serious side effects."

                 <p class="small">
                    Several health conditions, your lifestyle, and your age and family history can increase your risk for heart disease. These are called risk factors. About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking.1
                    Some risk factors for heart disease cannot be controlled, such as your age or family history. But you can take steps to lower your risk by changing the factors you can control.
