                      AIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn’t mean they’ll develop AIDS.
                    </p>
                    <p class="writer">By Ann Pietrangelo</p>

                    <p class="big">What Is HIV?</p>
                    <p class="small">HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.

                      If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
                      
                      The human body can’t get rid of HIV and no effective HIV cure exists. So, once you have HIV, you have it for life.
                      
                      However, by taking HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART), people with HIV can live long and healthy lives and prevent transmitting HIV to their sexual partners. In addition, there are effective methods to prevent getting HIV through sex or drug use, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).
                      
                      First identified in 1981, HIV is the cause of one of humanity’s deadliest and most persistent epidemics.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="big">What Is AIDS?</p>
                    <p class="small">AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the body’s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.

                      In the U.S., most people with HIV do not develop AIDS because taking HIV medicine every day as prescribed stops the progression of the disease.
                      
                      A person with HIV is considered to have progressed to AIDS when:
                      
                      the number of their CD4 cells falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood (200 cells/mm3). (In someone with a healthy immune system, CD4 counts are between 500 and 1,600 cells/mm3.) OR
                      they develop one or more opportunistic infections regardless of their CD4 count.
                      Without HIV medicine, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years. Once someone has a dangerous opportunistic illness, life expectancy without treatment falls to about 1 year. HIV medicine can still help people at this stage of HIV infection, and it can even be lifesaving. But people who start ART soon after they get HIV experience more benefits—that’s why HIV testing is so important.

                    <p class="big">How Do I Know If I Have HIV?</p>
                    <p class="small">
                      The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested. Testing is relatively simple. You can ask your health care provider for an HIV test. Many medical clinics, substance abuse programs, community health centers, and hospitals offer them too. You can also buy a home testing kit at a pharmacy or online.
                    </p>
                   
                    <p class="big">How Do You Get or Transmit HIV?</p>
                    <p class="small"> 
                      You can only get HIV by coming into direct contact with certain body fluids from a person with HIV who has a detectable viral load. These fluids are:

                      Blood
                      Semen (cum) and pre-seminal fluid
                      Rectal fluids
                      Vaginal fluids
                        Breast milk
                      For transmission to occur, the HIV in these fluids must get into the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person through a mucous membrane (found in the rectum, vagina, mouth, or tip of the penis); open cuts or sores; or by direct injection.

                    People with HIV who take HIV medicine daily as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partners.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="big">
                      How Is HIV Spread from Person to Person?
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                      HIV can only be spread through specific activities. In the United States, the most common ways are:

                    Having vaginal or anal sex with someone who has HIV without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV. Anal sex is riskier than vaginal sex.
                    Sharing injection drug equipment (“works”), such as needles, with someone who has HIV.
                    Less common ways are:

                    From mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. However, the use of HIV medicines and other strategies have helped lower the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV to 1% or less in the United States.
                    Getting stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle or other sharp object. This is a risk mainly for health care workers. The risk is very low.
                    HIV is spread only in extremely rare cases by:

                    Having oral sex. But in general, the chance that an HIV-negative person will get HIV from oral sex with an HIV-positive partner is extremely low.
                    Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV. The risk is extremely small these days because of rigorous testing of the U.S. blood supply and donated organs and tissues.
                    Being bitten by a person with HIV. Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken.
                    Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids.
                    Deep, open-mouth kissing if both partners have sores or bleeding gums and blood from the HIV-positive partner gets into the bloodstream of the HIV-negative partner. HIV is not spread through saliva.
                    Eating food that has been pre-chewed by a person with HIV. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="big">Ways HIV Cannot Be Spread</p>
                    <p class="small">HIV is not spread by:

                      Air or water
                      Mosquitoes, ticks or other insects
                      Saliva, tears, or sweat that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV
                      Shaking hands; hugging; sharing toilets; sharing dishes, silverware, or drinking glasses; or engaging in closed-mouth or “social” kissing with a person with HIV
                      Drinking fountains
                      Other sexual activities that don’t involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching).
                      HIV can’t be passed through healthy, unbroken skin.
